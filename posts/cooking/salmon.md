# Walnut-encrusted Baked Salmon

20min prep, 15min cook (if you're slow like me)

## Ingredients

per serving:

250g Salmon (portions cut from filets is easier)

50g walnuts

10g butter

dill, to your taste

50g bulgogi sauce

## Settings

Preheat oven to `425F`/`200C`

Preheat pan for toasting

Layer foil onto a baking sheet, grease lightly

## Prep

Chop walnuts finely, start toasting 

----

Chop dill

Melt butter in microwave

mix dill and butter

place salmon on baking dish skin side down

score salmon flesh

brush dill butter onto and in salmon

----

To walnuts, add bulgogi sauce and turn to low heat to start reducing

## Cook

Bake salmon for 15 minutes (depends on your fish size, thicker means longer)

Once sauce becomes thick enough to pile up, take off heat but keep somewhat warmed for lower viscosity

Once salmon is done, apply sauce in a flat layer on top of still hot salmon 

Let sit for at least 5 minutes to firm up

Done!
