# Pursing the Perfect Laser Pointer

With the power of the OSRAM PL530 OPSL revealed in the [holography laser](holographer.md), the next step is naturally to turn it into a pointer.

Crap... with its ridiculously low spot size, the beam must expand to at least about 1mm^2 for advantageous etendue tradeoff. But that takes over 1 decimeter, and I do not have diffraction-limited lenses with that focal length. The best I can muster now is a 50mm or so, and that one only gives a final divergence of 2.1mm/3.3m, or 0.68milliradian which isn't better than my current best greens. Beam quality is of course much higher giving unrealized potential. 

Starting stats are spot size ??? divergence 7milliradian. Want at least 20x drop, so 20* increase in spot size first. That is a lot. Until I can get diffraction-limited aspherics with a focal length of over 1dm, this project will have to be suspended.
